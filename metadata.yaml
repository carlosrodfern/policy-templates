    tldr: Restrict access to maintenance tools (apk, mii-tool, ...)
    detailed: Container images might contain maintenance tools which should ideally
      never be used in prod env, or if used, should be used only in certain time frames.
      Examples include, dynamic package management tools, mii-tool, iptables etc

    detailed: Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory 
       on the local system prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or 
       combined into one file through techniques such as Archive Collected Data. 
       Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within cmd and 
       bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

    tldr: Deny package manager execution
    detailed: Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. 
        Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many 
        variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific 
        OS or distribution.[1][2] Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain 
        commands requiring elevated privileges.

    tldr: Deny access to serviceaccount files
    detailed: Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within a containers environment. 
        APIs in these environments, such as the Docker API and Kubernetes APIs, allow a user to 
        remotely manage their container resources and cluster components. An adversary may access the 
        Docker API to collect logs that contain credentials to cloud, container, and various 
        other resources in the environment. An adversary with sufficient permissions, such as 
        via a pod's service account, may also use the Kubernetes API to retrieve credentials from 
        the Kubernetes API server. These credentials may include those needed for Docker API 
        authentication or secrets from Kubernetes cluster components.

    tldr: Restrict access to trusted certificated bundles in the OS image
    detailed: Operating systems maintain a list of trusted certificates (often called
      trust bundles) in file system. These bundles decides which authorities are trusted.
      Subverting these trust controls would essentially allow an adversary to operate
      as a trusted entity. Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either
      warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs.
      Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs
      or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features would
      include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code
      signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it
      has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an
      indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.
